Further, by considering the extent to which modernity is about rewriting the past, it will associate periodization with issues of canonicity. Canonicity will be approached mainly in terms of literary fashion and literary value: we will consider when and why some texts remain read and taught, and in what ways they are consumed.

At some point during the eighteenth century, this question went from being more or less meaningless to one of the central preoccupations of Western literature and culture: the driving principle of countless\u00e2\u0080\u0094if not most\u00e2\u0080\u0094classic novels, and the occasion for many canonical works in other genres and media. The idea that the shape of an individual life follows a basic pattern of development, leading from the open-ended possibility of youth to the stable identity of adulthood, seems self-evident to us, but this idea has a history: it has been figured, configured and reconfigured in many different ways over the past 250 years, and continues to mutate and develop under our eyes today. The aim of this course is to track the related ideas of youth, adulthood and development over this period, as they are represented in key works of literature and cinema, and especially within the genre of the Bildungsroman. Our inquiry will be guided by the assumption that narratives of development, in prose, poetry and film, are not only passive reflections of reality, but rather that these literary and film representations are essential tools for making sense of our time-bound lives. Accordingly, your engagement with these questions will take the form of class discussion and a traditional essay, but also an original narrative in which you implement your understanding of the genre.

Media play key roles in the sciences of climate change themselves. For example, climate change sciences use computer modelling extensively, and also rely on global media networks that both circulate environmental data and allow for collaboration and discussion among scientists. Media also play a role in bringing climate change science to the public. In the process, media help frame the way climate change is discussed. Media thus play a fascinating if often conflicted series of roles in setting key social and political agendas with regard to climate change. On the other hand, dealing with climate change has challenged the way that media work. The mainstream media has had to change its approach to what counts as news, and to the way it sets agendas. Journalists have had to grapple with complex science in new ways. At the same time, newer media technologies such as social media and blogging platforms have augmented and often by-passed more traditional media platforms. This has transformed communications around environmental issues such as climate change.

The rest of the semester, including lectures and tutorial readings and discussions, will be organised around two to three broad themes that are based on the chosen topics.\nThe key focus will be on the application of relevant theories, frameworks and concepts on these topics, and an exploration of appropriate methodologies for their analysis. The topics covered could include, for instance, digital media affordances, political communication as public strategy, online radicalisation, social media use and counter-publics, the political economy of IT industries, or surveillance and security, covering the themes of media in the public domain and media in the private domain, as well as the intersections of the two. The methodologies discussed could, in turn, include textual analysis and deconstruction, auto-ethnography, and conjunctural analysis.

In this context disciplines of anthropology, ethnography, archaeology and museology are examined. Particular attention is given to the ways in which we can study objects and their different meanings as they journey from Indigenous contexts to non-Indigenous institutions. Students undertake an excursion to one or more local museums and participate in interactive seminar discussion as part of this course.\n", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/ATSI2003", "outline_url": "http://www.nuragili.unsw.edu.au/", "requirements": "Prerequisite: 30 units of credit at Level 1"}, {"name": "Popular Culture of Indigenous Australia", "study_level": "undergraduate", "code": "ATSI2004", "keywords": "nura gili (indigenous programs),aboriginal,aboriginal peoples,australia,popular culture,indigenous communication,torres strait islands,indigenous", "description": "Representations and misrepresentations of Australian Indigeneity as part of the national identity are most often portrayed through forms of popular culture.

The course is situated in the 'Beginner Level' in the CoDe student specialisation journey and therefore available for enrolment as an elective for all other UNSW undergrad students.\nIn the early nineties, the concept of the paperless studio and the integration of digital media into design practice; the 'digital turn', were considered to be merely experiments undertaken by the avant-garde. Today, computation is embedded in all aspects of design practice from conception to construction. New digital design techniques have been joined by new methodologies and formal outcomes. The representation of design has greater sophistication and we understand more about the effects of digital imagery. Computation has also infiltrated the construction of our built environment, from materiality to management. Highly complex information systems process, analyse and integrate components in 3D virtual spaces.\nComputation is ubiquitous in our built environment, and its integration has had significant effect on the culture of the design and built environment. The interest we have in technology has moved beyond merely the creation of blob architecture into the new possibilities and challenges it offers to parametrics, sustainability and fabrication. This course will explore the elaborate relationship between computer, the designer and the design and construction of our built environment. The semester's lectures will help in better understanding the relationships and effect of the continual change and evolution on the social and cultural aspects of our design practices. A range of bridging theories essential to the 'digital turn' in building information management, information modelling, as well as the agency for simulation and optimization will be introduced. For example, pre-BIM design concepts; agency in architecture; visualization; materiality and material practice; robotics and making, BIM in practice and so on.\nStudents will have an opportunity to develop their understanding of ideas and issues through their participation in a critical discussion group.

A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f.

The thesis requires you\u00c2\u00a0to formulate problems in scientific or engineering terms, manage an technical\u00c2\u00a0project and find solutions by applying scientific and engineering methods. You will also develop their ability to work in a research and development environment. You must identify a supervisor and project prior to enrolling in this course. This is the third course of the 3 course thesis structure.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/ELEC4953", "outline_url": "", "requirements": ""}]}, {"code": "ENGG", "name": "Engineering interdisciplinary", "url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/EngineeringInterdisciplinary/browse?sa=a9ce03204f0f5b00eeb3eb4f0310c7a8", "courses": [{"name": "Communicating in Engineering", "study_level": "undergraduate", "code": "ENGG0360", "keywords": "engineering interdisciplinary", "description": "The expectations and conventions applying to spoken and written communications within engineering and science.

Woven through the course is a critical examination of the interaction between the criminal justice system and the criminal law: specifically, that application of the law is shaped by and dependent on decisions made by criminal justice actors including police, prosecutors and judicial officers. Specific areas of focus include: why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.\n\nCrime and the Criminal Process also introduces the doctrinal building blocks of criminal law, and applies these principles to a number of key statutory offences such as public order offences and drugs offences which illustrate the process themes above. The impact of public policy and law reform is an important underlying theme.\u00c2\u00a0\nMain Topics\nCriminalisation, over-criminalisation and defining crimeCriminal process, including police powers and pre-trial processComponents of criminal offences: physical and mental elementsDrugs (NSW only), including harm minimisation policies and incursions into general principles of criminal lawPublic order offenses\n", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS1021", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "requirements": "This course is strictly for students undertaking Law programs only."}, {"name": "Criminal Laws", "study_level": "undergraduate", "code": "LAWS1022", "keywords": "law,criminal law,criminal justice,criminal procedure", "description": "LAWS1022 is only available in T3 by School Consent.

These are examined in a contextual framework that emphasises the policy and social issues underpinning the development and application of the law. This critical approach allows students to appreciate a complex set of conflicting ideologies, principles, discretion and histories informing the criminal law.

Social issues including race, class and gender are stressed. Comparisons with jurisdictions other than NSW are undertaken where this highlights relevant policy issues, legislative alternatives, or demonstrates the contingent nature of the law in question.

Students will acquire an understanding of the introductory principles and theories of administrative and constitutional law as they apply to the essential features of the Australian system of government, and their implications for human rights and the rule of law. The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change. The course prepares students for their later study of the courses LAWS1160: Administrative Law and LAWS2150: Federal Constitutional Law, and also introduces students to the fundamentals of the skill of statutory interpretation in the public law context.\u00c2\u00a0\nMain Topics\nConstitutionalism\nAustralia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098Washminster\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Inheritance\n- The Westminster Tradition\n- The American Tradition\nThe Creation of the Federated Commonwealth of Australia\n- Colonisation, Indigenous Sovereignty and Crown Sovereignty\n- The Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and the Path to Federation\n- The Acquisition of Legal Independence and Popular Sovereignty\nThe Legislature\n- History and Development\n- The Franchise and the Composition of Parliament\n- Legislative Power\n- Judicial Review of Legislation\n- Statutory Interpretation\n- State Constitutions and State Legislative Power\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Executive\n- History and Development\n- Federal and State Executive Power\n- Judicial Review of Executive Action\n- Non-Judicial Forms of Executive Accountability\nThe Judiciary\n- History, Development and Composition\n- A Foundation of Judicial Independence\n\u00c2\u00a0\nRights Protection and Australian Constitutionalism\nConstitutional Change.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS1141", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "requirements": "This course is strictly for students undertaking Law programs only."}, {"name": "Principles of Private Law", "study_level": "undergraduate", "code": "LAWS1150", "keywords": "law,private law,contracts,property law,agency,partnership", "description": "LAWS1150\u00c2\u00a0is only available in T1 by School Consent.

With respect to property law, this course considers the boundaries of the concept of property, as well as several of the rules with respect to the creation, transfer and protection of property rights. Again several other elements of property law are dealt with later in Land Law, and to some extent also in Equity and Trusts.\nThe course also introduces students to two smaller topics: agency and equitable estoppel.

It examines the structures, rules and values that enable ethical practice for lawyers. The course explores ethical issues that arise in professional practice and the regulations and standards that govern them. It considers these issues and principles in light of our personal values, experiences and psychological biases, as well as wider and dynamic professional contexts. These contexts include the history and workings of the legal profession and its rapidly changing circumstances. They also include the diverse and demanding environments in which contemporary lawyers work. \nThis course treats questions of ethics as found in everyday decisions and behaviour, general as well as those particular to lawyers. However, Lawyers, Ethics & Justice addresses, in particular, the responsibilities of lawyers in maintaining the integrity of the justice system. In doing so, students will analyse the roles lawyers do and should play in the justice system, and relate them to the values and routine skills lawyers have, or should have, to ensure effective and just outcomes. \nThe course is also designed for students to evaluate the conduct of lawyers, the nature of ethical practice, and the pursuit of justice in light of their own identities, values and skills. Students are asked to consider what acting in accordance their values would mean for their own professional lives. \nDuring the course, students will start to develop the skills they will need to engage in ethical legal practice, including those to: identify and address ethics issues; work with colleagues and other professionals to institute and maintain ethical work practices; recognise and manage the diverse needs and interests of clients; and integrate often competing duties to clients, the workplace, the profession, the judicial system and society.

The course is theoretical in the following sense.\u00c2\u00a0 In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all.\u00c2\u00a0 They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules.\u00c2\u00a0 Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than about them.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nLegal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within.\u00c2\u00a0 It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law.\u00c2\u00a0 Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nLegal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.\u00c2\u00a0 It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nTheoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nIn general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 legal positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.\n\nAlong the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nIn order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain \u00e2\u0080\u0098problems\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of contemporary legal practice.

The point of departure will be a consideration of the character of justice. Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.\nNot only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice?

It traces the historical development of equity and its relationship with common law. Students will critically consider the appropriate application of a range of equitable doctrines to particular scenarios and the availability of different remedies. Students will also be introduced to the law of trusts and, in particular, the nature of a trust, legal requirements in establishing a trust as well as the rights, duties and powers associated with trusts. The course assumes familiarity with equitable doctrines taught in Principles of Private Law and Contracts (alternatively Contracts 1 and 2), for instance estoppel, undue influence, unconscionability. For students who have not completed Principles of Private Law, the course will include a transitional module on personal property to introduce subject matter that was previously taught in Property, Equity and Trusts and will in future be taught in Principles of Private Law. This is an important pre-requisite for learning about trusts, which involve property.\n\nThis course is one of the core subjects for law and will normally be taken after completion of Contracts. It fits within the private law stream, which includes such subjects as Torts, Contracts and Land Law. It provides a good grounding for further studies in this area.\nIn addition, the course will incorporate on-line and classroom tutorials that teach students how to refine their skills in retrieving legal research, working through complex legal research problems and writing up research in professional contexts. These modules are ONLY required for students who have NOT completed Advanced Legal Research (ALR). Those students will be assigned to \"tutorial\" groups for the purposes of these modules. Students who have completed ALR will be assigned for administrative purposes to tutorials with no classes.\nMain Topics\nThe aim of the course is to ensure that you are familiar with the central principles of equity, including the law of trusts. In particular, the course will cover the following topics:\nEquitable rights and equitable titlesFiduciary obligationsAssignment and Priorities (excluding Torrens land)Express trusts, including\n\tTypes of express trustTrusts distinguished from contract, charge, lien, bailment and corporationLifecycle of an express trustTrustee duties, powers and rightsBeneficiary rights\nTracingPersonal liability of accessories and recipientsRemediesResulting and constructive trustsGeneral bars to relief\nMain topics (legal research and writing modules)\nCommentary and secondary sourcesCase lawLegislation\n\u00c2\u00a0\n", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS2385", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "requirements": "Prerequisite: Principles of Private Law (LAWS1150/JURD7150) and Contracts (LAWS1075/ JURD7175)"}, {"name": "Law and Social Theory", "study_level": "undergraduate", "code": "LAWS2820", "keywords": "law,sociology of law and social theory,law and social theory", "description": "\nIn their practical day-to-day activities, lawyers and citizens take, and must take, much for granted, both about society inwhich they work and live and about its legal order. Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or lesssettled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specificsocial arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely heldand shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories andarrangements, rather than about them.\nTheoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It isconcerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how itworks and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which peoplelive. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quiteunreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions it plays, what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.\nThis course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationshipsbetween law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching theseissues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.\nThe course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinctrange of questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a distinct way of asking such questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094about socio-legal relations.\nPart 1\u00e2\u0080\u0094Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society\nClassical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoingmassive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differedmarkedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace whichwere unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreattransformation\u00e2\u0080\u009d formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not beenconsidered as urgently or directly before.\nAmong these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large andcomplex societies \u00e2\u0080\u009chang together\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically thelaw presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that arenot amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialisedtechniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged theattention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.\n1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?3.

It examines the following question: What does the concept \"biology\"\u00c2\u00a0do\u00c2\u00a0in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as \"nature\", \"bodies\", \"organism\", \"groups\" or \"life\" (to name just a few). \"Law and Biology\" aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.\nThe unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similarto these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system.\u00c2\u00a0\nStudents wishing to think about law \u00e2\u0080\u009coutside the box\" and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course.

This fosters the assumption that litigation, or legal advice predicting the outcome of litigation, is the normal method of resolving disputes. In fact only a small proportion of disputes are resolved by litigation and there is a growing dissatisfaction with the cost, speed and adversarial character of litigation, and a corresponding interest in alternative forms of non-adjudicative dispute resolution.\nThis course follows on from Resolving Civil Disputes, investigating and giving practical experience in a range of alternative forms of dispute resolution including negotiation, facilitation, mediation and group process. It requires students to identify and analyse examples of the interface between the outcomes of non-adjudicative dispute resolution processes and what might be termed 'black-letter law' such as contract and revenue law.\nDispute Resolution is delivered as a skills course. Whilst there will be some formal tuition, the focus of the course is on experiential learning.

It begins by exploring the question \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is justice\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice?

The course is theoretical in the following sense. In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take,and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions anddoctrines, and about the worth of it all. They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settledinstitutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided bythe legal system, rather than about them.\nLegal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within. It aims to probe anddiscuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law. Such questions include matters ofdescription and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us aboutwhat goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to suchquestions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors -are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural andimpossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarelyquestioned.\nLegal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows theseissues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed. It acquaints students with, and gives themopportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thoughtabout the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument oreven discussion at all.\nTheoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether theyemerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believenew or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questionsdiscussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.\nIn general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 legalpositivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking aboutpolitical life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independentlyof non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselvesas self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly theycontribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.\nAlong the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. Theseinclude - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theorybetween the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship to rights and to cultural andreligious difference, and law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.\nIn order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain \u00e2\u0080\u0098problems\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of contemporary legal practice.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them.\nTheoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it works and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays,\n\nwhat it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThe course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct range of questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a distinct way of asking such questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094about socio-legal relations.\n\nPart 1\u00e2\u0080\u0094Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society\n\u00c2\u00a0\nClassical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat transformation\u00e2\u0080\u009d formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAmong these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies \u00e2\u0080\u009chang together\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.\n\n1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?\n\u00c2\u00a0\n2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?\n\u00c2\u00a0\n3.

These include self-organised regional, interstate and overseas hosts.\nIN THE LAW SCHOOL\nInterns are required to attend seminars staggered throughout the Term (11 face-to-face contact hours in total). Modules for these seminars will cover topics such as professionalism, balance and resilience, networking and communication skills, and connecting the dots from internship to career. The purpose of the seminars is to promote discussion and reflection on a range of issues that may arise during the course of the internship, for example, legal, professional, ethical and personal issues. They may also address the application of skills, such as legal research, legal writing, advocacy and interviewing.\nIn addition, an online module covering topics such as setting goals, professional behaviour, ethics and reflective journaling must be completed by the student prior to the first day of their internship.\u00c2\u00a0\nAttendance by interns at the host organisation and seminars is mandatory. Students whose attendance falls below the specified 10 days or who do not attend Seminars without a medical certificate or other adequate evidence will be deemed not to have completed the subject requirements and will not be eligible to pass the course.\n", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS3555", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "requirements": "Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses."}, {"name": "Complex Civil Litigation", "study_level": "undergraduate", "code": "LAWS3589", "keywords": "law,complex civil litigation", "description": "Civil litigation is more frequently giving rise to cases that are  labelled \"mega-litigation\", \"heavy and complex\" or \"supercase\".

As consumers, we purchase services every day \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be they retail banking, using a supermarket or restaurant, a holiday, medical services, transportation, visiting immigration consultants, travel agents or hairdressers (higher education is also a service!). Professional services (of a B2B or B2C nature) are equally prominent and include legal services, financial planning, accountancy, architects, management consultancy, financial services, information technology, market research, and engineering services. Experiential services (tourism, sport, theatre) are also growing. However, it is important to remember that many product-based organisations (e.g., IBM, Federal Express) have a strong service component.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis course was developed because for business, in any industry, service provision is a key differentiator. The implications of service provision, and how services are best managed and marketed, are steadily gaining importance. Therefore, students who plan to work in service industries, or the customer service division of manufacturing industries, must be prepared sufficiently to do so. This course aims to help students understand the practical implications of the unique characteristics of services and service provision and to help them cope with the challenges of marketing and managing a service. To achieve this aim, we build upon, and expand, marketing management concepts and models, demonstrating how they apply to the services sector. This course focuses on the\u00c2\u00a0distinctive characteristics and problems of marketing in service organizations and for any organization developing and marketing services as part of its business portfolio. It demonstrates why and how services require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy-both in its development and in its execution. This course examines cases from commercial and not-for-profit organizations including banking, transportation, hotels, tourism, hospitals, education and professional services such as accountancy, engineering, and management consultancy.

Increases in leisure time and discretionary spending have led to a proliferation of public events, celebrations and entertainment, making the events sector one of the fastest growing segments of tourism in the world. Countries and cities compete vigorously for mega events such as the Olympics, World Cup and World Fairs while societies are increasingly holding smaller scale events such as fairs, festivals, markets, parades, anniversaries or sporting events.Governments now support and promote events as part of their strategies for economic development, nation building and destination marketing. Events serve to attract visitation and to create an image of and awareness for a destination. Managed appropriately, events can produce sizeable economic and social benefits. Inappropriate management can lead to negative economic, environmental and social impacts. Events require considerable investment, planning and organisation to safeguard the health, safety and security of visitors and participants to ensure operators, visitors and the community derive the maximum possible benefit from the event.

In addition to these specified modules, students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete phase 3 requirements. The order and content of work undertaken in these courses will be organised for each student on an individual basis through the relevant Clinical School(s).\nIn considering their choice of modules in Phase 3, the student's clinical experience must include a minimum of 8 weeks in community or ambulatory settings, as well as 8 weeks experience of emergency or critical care, although these may be spread over one or more individual modules.

Universal though these truths might appear to be, the various musical expressions of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peoples are as diverse, unique, and sometimes strange, as the natural and cultural worlds that make them. Today we can access that musical diversity easily. We can buy it, download it, iPod it. But just how much do we know about the peoples, histories, sentiments, and lives of the musicians and singers that produce this music? How much do we grasp the beauty, the yearning, and the spirituality in that music? What can we learn that will deepen our appreciation, understanding, and perhaps performance of the many musical expressions available to us today?\nThis World Music course surveys and examines the relationships between music, the society in which it is performed, and individual selves. It explores both traditional and contemporary music of Aboriginal Australia, South-east Asia, India, Central Asia and the Middle East, West Africa and the Caribbean, and marginal Europe. It examines how musical practices express, shape, and allow for the individual and collective construction and negotiation of identity, ethnicity, gender, spirituality and class.

Bayesian networks, which display graphically the interrelationships between variables, allow for their dependencies to be accounted for in a manner reflecting their causal relationships. This permits the evaluation of predicted consequences associated with different interventions, before these are actually implemented. MCDA allows decisions to be made when the decision-maker is faced with multiple and conflicting objectives where tradeoffs must be made, which is most often the case in the real world.

In this class the so-called 'rise of the APT' is examined from a number of perspectives: against the backdrop of the explosion of international art events known as Biennales of Art and against the question of the usefulness of the concept of an Asia-Pacific region, given changing economic and political conditions.

How accurate will the answers be, and how can they be checked? One need not understand all the mathematics of the finite element to answer these questions. However a competent user must have an understanding of the preliminary mathematics and must be able to understand how elements behave in order to choose suitable kinds, sizes and shapes of elements, and to guard against misinterpretations and unrealistically high expectations. This course is a balanced theoretical and practical introduction to the use of the FE method. The first chapter deals with matrix structural analysis, which is the ancestor of the finite element method. The second chapter deals with finite element approximation and numerical integration.

The organisation of the city, for example, has been an important theme since antiquity. Plato, one of the West\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most famous and influential philosophers, spent a good deal of thought on what constitutes the ideal city, who would be its legitimate and illegitimate inhabitants and who would govern it.\nIn modern times the goal of influencing behaviour through city planning is clearly evident. Modernists such as Baron von Hausmann and Le Corbusier and, closer to home, Walter Burley Griffin, recognised the role that space played in shaping the behaviour of individuals and in shaping the direction of society. Yet although space can be planned to some degree to direct people to act, speak and even think in certain ways, there are of course many other facets of human action that thwart the best laid plans. The unpredictability of human action ensures a constantly changing landscape, which can only be explained by understanding the interplay between people and space.\nThe material examined is topical in nature and includes Australian and international examples, with a focus on urban environments. This course is designed to open your eyes to different interpretations of places, events and behaviours.\nThe aim of the course, using real-world, student-driven case studies, is for you to have a deep appreciation of the relationship between environments and the behaviours and opportunities of people living in these environments.
