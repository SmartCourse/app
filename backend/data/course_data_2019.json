Students will learn to do that effectively in a digital age where the content is easily accessed but the understanding of that information is harder to achieve. They will also learn how to measure the effectiveness of their communication of science. Understanding the art of evidence based science communication has become more important than ever before in a world where fake science news threatens our ability to communicate science effectively. \nFor those students going on to a higher degree in science, a basic requirement of being a successful scientist is to be able to effectively communicate. However, very few scientists have had any formal evidence-based science communication education. Fewer still have been taught how new emerging communication technologies can engage audiences with science or how to use emotion and be personable when communicating science. This course prepares students for a career in their chosen science discipline.\nThe objective of BEES6800 is to help students to gain confidence in clearly communicating science and why it matters across multiple peer and public audiences in multiple modes, and via multiple digital technologies and media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including social media. \nThe course is mostly online. \nThere are two face-to-face weeks for which there will be an online equivalent of at least lecture recordings for students unable to attend in person. One of these two weeks will be an experience in the Mars Lab education and research facility at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, and in which UNSW is a partner. The second will be a week of activities, including discussion and debate, on the issues of fake science news and miscommunication of science news.\nAssessment will be through three connected online assignments that directly address course outcomes.These outcomes include understanding the nature and processes of science, being able to communicate science clearly with multiple audiences in multiple modes, understanding the best use of new and emerging technologies to communicate science, thinking critically and creatively, and knowing how to measure the effectiveness of science communication.\nThere is no final exam. \nStudents need 48 Units of Credit to take this science elective course.

It examines the structures, rules and values that enable ethical practice for lawyers. The course explores ethical issues that arise in professional practice and the regulations and standards that govern them. It considers these issues and principles in light of our personal values, experiences and psychological biases, as well as wider and dynamic professional contexts. These contexts include the history and workings of the legal profession and its rapidly changing circumstances. They also include the diverse and demanding environments in which contemporary lawyers work. \nThis course treats questions of ethics as found in everyday decisions and behaviour, general as well as those particular to lawyers. However, Lawyers, Ethics & Justice addresses, in particular, the responsibilities of lawyers in maintaining the integrity of the justice system. In doing so, students will analyse the roles lawyers do and should play in the justice system, and relate them to the values and routine skills lawyers have, or should have, to ensure effective and just outcomes. \nThe course is also designed for students to evaluate the conduct of lawyers, the nature of ethical practice, and the pursuit of justice in light of their own identities, values and skills. Students are asked to consider what acting in accordance their values would mean for their own professional lives. \nDuring the course, students will start to develop the skills they will need to engage in ethical legal practice, including those to: identify and address ethics issues; work with colleagues and other professionals to institute and maintain ethical work practices; recognise and manage the diverse needs and interests of clients; and integrate often competing duties to clients, the workplace, the profession, the judicial system and society.

The course is theoretical in the following sense.\u00c2\u00a0 In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all.\u00c2\u00a0 They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules.\u00c2\u00a0 Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than about them.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nLegal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within.\u00c2\u00a0 It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law.\u00c2\u00a0 Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nLegal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.\u00c2\u00a0 It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nTheoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nIn general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 legal positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.\n\nAlong the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy...", "study_level": "undergraduate", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS2320", "keywords": "law,legal theory", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "name": "Legal Theory"}, {"code": "LAWS2326", "requirements": "Pre-requisite: 24 UOC completed in LLB courses or 24 UOC completed in Juris Doctor courses...", "description": "This course seeks to understand the nature of law and justice and, in particular...", "study_level": "undergraduate", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS2326", "keywords": "law,legal theory,social theory,ethics,social justice", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "name": "Theories of Law and Justice"}, {"code": "LAWS2351", "requirements": "Prerequisite: Crime and Criminal Process (LAWS1021/JURD7121) and Criminal Laws (LAWS1022/JURD7122)", "description": "LAWS2351 is only available in T1 by School Consent.

These topics are examined in their legal, ethical and socio-psychological dimensions. The course approaches these topics by first exploring the legal and factual elements that define evidence law. In the criminal context, the course additionally explores prosecutors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ethical and legal obligations to the court and to the defendant. From this preliminary framework students examine key principles, rules and institutional elements associated with the formal adjudication of legal disputes. Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uniform evidence legislation provides the major doctrinal focus of this course. Its institutional focus centres on the role of participants in the court process. The course aims to foster in students critical analytical skills and values consistent with aspirational ideals of professional and ethical legal practice. These goals are pursued by observational fieldwork, audiovisual aids, occasional guest speakers, readings and the engagement of students in classroom discussion that is aimed at developing their understanding of the complexities and challenges evidence law and court processes create for litigants, lawyers, witnesses and decisionmakers.

It traces the historical development of equity and its relationship with common law. Students will critically consider the appropriate application of a range of equitable doctrines to particular scenarios and the availability of different remedies. Students will also be introduced to the law of trusts and, in particular, the nature of a trust, legal requirements in establishing a trust as well as the rights, duties and powers associated with trusts. The course assumes familiarity with equitable doctrines taught in Principles of Private Law and Contracts (alternatively Contracts 1 and 2), for instance estoppel, undue influence, unconscionability. For students who have not completed Principles of Private Law, the course will include a transitional module on personal property to introduce subject matter that was previously taught in Property, Equity and Trusts and will in future be taught in Principles of Private Law. This is an important pre-requisite for learning about trusts, which involve property.\n\nThis course is one of the core subjects for law and will normally be taken after completion of Contracts. It fits within the private law stream, which includes such subjects as Torts, Contracts and Land Law. It provides a good grounding for further studies in this area.\nIn addition, the course will incorporate on-line and classroom tutorials that teach students how to refine their skills in retrieving legal research, working through complex legal research problems and writing up research in professional contexts. These modules are ONLY required for students who have NOT completed Advanced Legal Research (ALR). Those students will be assigned to \"tutorial\" groups for the purposes of these modules.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or lesssettled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specificsocial arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely heldand shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories andarrangements, rather than about them.\nTheoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It isconcerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how itworks and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which peoplelive. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quiteunreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions it plays, what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.\nThis course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationshipsbetween law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching theseissues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.\nThe course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinctrange of questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a distinct way of asking such questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094about socio-legal relations.\nPart 1\u00e2\u0080\u0094Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society\nClassical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoingmassive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differedmarkedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace whichwere unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreattransformation\u00e2\u0080\u009d formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not beenconsidered as urgently or directly before.\nAmong these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large andcomplex societies \u00e2\u0080\u009chang together\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically thelaw presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that arenot amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialisedtechniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged theattention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.\n1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?2.

They grant foreign investors broad protections from interference by the governments of the countries in which they invest. They also establish an international mechanism for adjudication and enforcement, allowing foreign investors to bypass national courts and, instead, bring cases against states directly to international arbitration. The amount at stake in these disputes regularly runs into billions of dollars. Philip Morris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recent case against Australia arising from Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tobacco plain packaging legislation is a high profile example. Supporters argue that investment treaties promote foreign investment and respect for the rule of law in countries that are bound by them. Critics argue that investment treaties constitute a \u00e2\u0080\u0098bill of rights for multinational corporations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that is enforced through \u00e2\u0080\u0098secret courts\u00e2\u0080\u0099. \nThis course provides an introduction to the law and policy of the investment treaty regime. The course covers the network of almost 3000 bilateral investment treaties, along with the investment chapters of multi-issue free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. It also covers international dispute settlement through investment treaty arbitration under the ICSID and UNCITRAL Rules.

It examines the following question: What does the concept \"biology\"\u00c2\u00a0do\u00c2\u00a0in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as \"nature\", \"bodies\", \"organism\", \"groups\" or \"life\" (to name just a few). \"Law and Biology\" aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.\nThe unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similarto these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system.\u00c2\u00a0\nStudents wishing to think about law \u00e2\u0080\u009coutside the box\" and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course.

A minority of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population grow food, and in highly urbanised countries that minority is vanishingly small. Less than 0.01% of Australians are employed in agriculture of any kind. Modern agriculture is industrialised and food production corporatized. However, across the globe, there is a growing movement to reconnect with food production and to critically examine how food reaches our tables. Researchers and food activists are highlighting the social, cultural, ethical and environmental costs of modern food production, and exploring alternatives to industrial food systems.\nThis course will introduce students to a broad range of legal and policy issues, at both domestic and international level, that relate to food. Drawing on the expertise of multiple teachers, topics may include:\nRegulatory models that affect food production and distribution, including international covenants on food security and food aid, environmental laws, patents, trademarks, cultural heritage laws, biotechnology and health standards, animal rights, consumer laws and local government/planning law;\nBiotechnology and food production, including the demise of historical prohibitions on agricultural patents and public interest litigation around patenting life forms; the distinction between discovery and invention and its consequence; the distinction between open-pollenated seeds, hybrids and GMOs; contemporary developments in agribusiness and biotech patenting; plant variety rights; seed saving and farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights;\nThe environment and food, including the environmental impact of nutrient and pesticide pollution, biodiversity loss and deforestation, water overuse, carbon emissions and waste; legal and regulatory regimes designed to respond to these challenges, illustrated through case studies such as the pollution of the Great Barrier Reef by agriculture run-off; the regulation of water use in agriculture (70% of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water) and in the food chain (two thirds of our total water footprint), including legal rights to surface and groundwater, water planning, allocations, efficiency approaches, markets, pricing and enforcement;\nAboriginal science and rights to food, including an Indigenous Knowledges perspectives on science, agriculture and property rights to water, land, plants and animals, and data sovereignty; the regulation and use of this knowledge, including global initiatives around biopiracy; access and benefit sharing agreements; creative commons licensing; traditional knowledge databases; regional WIPO initiatives;\nDiverse legal models of enterprise in the food sector, particularly those that link production and distribution in innovative ways; the intersection between the sharing economy and the food system; the potential for innovative domestic models to help realise food-related international Sustainable Development goals;\nUrban agriculture, including the challenges of reconnecting overwhelmingly urban populations with food growing and production; legal rights to access land through public and private law; grassroots activism, community groups, allotments and guerrilla gardening, in Australia and overseas.\nInteractive classes on a range of issues will give students a broad understanding of laws and policies that

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them.\nTheoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it works and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays,\n\nwhat it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThe course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct range of questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a distinct way of asking such questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094about socio-legal relations.\n\nPart 1\u00e2\u0080\u0094Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society\n\u00c2\u00a0\nClassical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat transformation\u00e2\u0080\u009d formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAmong these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies \u00e2\u0080\u009chang together\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them...", "study_level": "undergraduate", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS3332", "keywords": "law,law and social theory", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "name": "Law and Social Theory"}, {"code": "LAWS3335", "requirements": "Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses", "description": "This course provides an introd...", "study_level": "undergraduate", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS3335", "keywords": "law,economic analysis of law", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "name": "Economic Analysis of Law"}, {"code": "LAWS3336", "requirements": "Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses", "description": "Course overview\nThe RACS Clinic is an experiential learning program in which students gain practical experience in refugee law practice, while critically reflecting on best practice legal service delivery methods.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAttending the clinic through attendance at RACS, students have significant responsibility working for, or in collaboration with, individual clients, under RACS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 supervision.

The course assumes that participants have little or no background in the law, and so the course also provides some basic instruction about important legal concepts and structures as well as policy approaches to implementation of regulation and enforcement of the law. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe learning outcomes expected on the completion of this course include:\nDemonstrate knowledge of the various sources of environmental law and policyIdentify the influence of common law and international environmental law on the development of Australian lawExplain the structure of environmental laws and engage in critical analysis of the different methods, both regulatory and incentive based, that may be used to implement environmental policyDemonstrate comprehension of the different ways in which environmental disputes may be resolvedNavigate and apply knowledge of environmental planning and assessment processes in the context of natural resourcesDemonstrate awareness of the social and economic context in which environmental law and policy has to be made and recognise the various pressures and influences on the search for optimal environmental protection lawsDemonstrate effective oral communication skills by delivering accurate and insightful contributions in class;Demonstrate effective written communication skills by articulating legal and policy concepts clearly, persuasively and appropriatelyDemonstrate an ability to incorporate a range of legal and interdisciplinary research sources in written communication with appropriate referencing...", "study_level": "undergraduate", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS9801", "keywords": "law,environmental law,environmental policy", "outline_url": "http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/courses/course-outlines", "name": "Aspects of Environmental Policy and Law"}], "code": "LAWS", "name": "Law"}, {"url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/Linguistics/browse?sa=f35f5e79dbf393000595c4048a96194b", "courses": [], "code": "LING", "name": "Linguistics"}, {"url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/ManufacturingEngineering/browse?sa=75ce43204f0f5b00eeb3eb4f0310c717", "courses": [{"code": "MANF3100", "requirements": "Prerequisite: ENGG1000 and (MMAN1130 or MMAN2130)", "description": "This course focuses on making certain that a design, whether mechanical, mechatronic or aerospace, can also be successfully manufactured, from a quality as well as cost perspective...", "study_level": "undergraduate", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/MANF3100", "keywords": "manufacturing engineering,product,manufacturing,design,qfd,technology", "outline_url": "http://www.mech.unsw.edu.au/", "name": "Product and Manufacturing Design"}, {"code": "MANF3510", "requirements": "Prerequisite: MMAN1130 or MMAN2130", "description": "This course focuses on manufacturing technology, including material removal, joining, additive and finishing processes and their characteristics, as well as the main building blocks of industrial automation including materials handling technologies and actuation technol...", "study_level": "undergraduate", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/MANF3510", "keywords": "manufacturing engineering,manufacturing,technology,cnc programming,programmable logic controller,robotics,automation", "outline_url": "http://www.mech.unsw.edu.au/", "name": "Process Technology and Automation"}, {"code": "MANF3610", "requirements": "Prerequisite: ENGG1811 or COMP1911 and MATH2089", "description": "Principles and techniques of operations research as well as an appreciation of the applications and computations in the field; principles of linear programming; the transportation algorithm; network models including critical path method (CPM) algorithm; deterministic dy...", "study_level": "undergraduate", "handbook_url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2019/MANF3610", "keywords": "manufacturing engineering", "outline_url": "http://www.mech.unsw.edu.au/", "name": "Manufacturing Operations"}, {"code": "MANF4020", "requirements": "No requirements found", "description": "Students will work in project teams to perform design and analysis of selected functions of manufacturing systems in collaboration with a manufacturing company.
