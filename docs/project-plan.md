## 1.0 - Product Statement
University is full of hard work and tough challenges. Unfortunately, this experience is made more difficult without a centralised source for course information. 'Smart Course' is our solution to this problem.

'Smart Course' is a web application that allows university students to ask questions, evaluate and share general information about courses all year long. Whether it be in the midst of subject selection time, or the week before finals, you can find out what you need to know!

## 3.0 - Releases

A release is when we merge code to master, and is a (at least partially) working product. The goal is to do the first release very early and then iterate.

We'll have several releases throughout the lifetime of the project; something along the lines of:
1. Prototypes (as early as possible):
    * Minimal/incomplete features.
    * Testing integration of features.
2. Minimal Viable Product (Week 8/9):
    * Basic minimal requirements met.
3. Final Product (Week 12):
    * Thoroughly tested and polished.

## 4.0 - Roles
In order to give everyone a taste of the different roles, we will be doing a fortnightly rotation for the 'Scrum Master' and 'Product Owner', whilst everyone is a 'Developer'.

The schedule is as follows:
* Sprint 0/1 (Week 3/4)
    * Scrum Master - Alex
    * Product Owner - Nuno
* Sprint 2/3 (Week 5/6)
    * Scrum Master - Luke
    * Product Owner - Alex
* Sprint 4/5 (Week 7/8)
    * Scrum Master - Travis
    * Product Owner - Luke
* Sprint 6/7 (Week 9/10)
    * Scrum Master - Nuno
    * Product Owner - Travis

    * Scrum Master - Alex
    * Product Owner - Nuno

## 5.0 - Sprints & Meeting Schedule

### Sprints
Each sprint is one week long (Thursday to Thursday). The goal for each sprint is to choose a subset of user stories to work on and ideally finish within that sprint. To enable this to occur in an efficient fashion, we have planeed for both standups and sprint reviews.

### Standups
The goal of the standup is for each team member to answer the follwoing 3 questions:
1. What have I been working on?
2. What am I working on next?
3. Is anything in my way?

Due to inability for the team to meet face-to-face throughout the week, our standups will occur in our dedicated slack channel (#standups), where each person will start their own thread when answering the questions. Discussion can then occur in the corresponding threads. We'll do these 3 times a week, on these days:
* Friday (8pm)
* Sunday (8pm)
* Tuesday (8pm)

### Sprint Review
Every Thursday, after the lecture, we'll do a 'Sprint Review' and organise the next sprint. The goal of this meeting is to:
1. Demo new features and make sure everyone in the team is up to speed with what's going on across the project.
2. Do a release if appropriate.
3. Evaluate the success of the sprint that just ended.
    * e.g. looking at burndown chart, seeing how many user stories were completed, etc.
4. Organise the next sprint:
    * Re-estimate tasks that took longer than expected, and possibly roll them over into the new sprint.
    * Determine new tasks/stories to be tackled in next sprint/
    * Allocate tasks to people.
