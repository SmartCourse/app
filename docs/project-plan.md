## 1.0 - Product Statement
University is full of hard work and tough challenges. Unfortunately, this experience is made more difficult without a centralised source for course information. 'Smart Course' is our solution to this problem.

'Smart Course' is a web application that allows university students to ask questions, evaluate and share general information about courses all year long. Whether it be in the midst of subject selection time, or the week before finals, you can find out what you need to know!
