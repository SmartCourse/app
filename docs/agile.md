# Agile

This document outlines the organisational aspects and goals of our agile workflow.

## Sprints

Each sprint is one week long. The goal for each sprint is to choose a subset of user stories to work on and ideally finish within that sprint.

### Standups

The goal of the standup is to answer, for each team member, 3 questions:
* What have I been working on?
* What am I working on next?
* Is anything in my way?

We'll do these 3 times a week, on these days:
* Friday
* Sunday
* Tuesday

### Sprint Review

Every Thursday, after the lecture, we'll do a Sprint Review, or 'Retro', and organise the next sprint.
The goal of this meeting is to:
* Demo new features and make sure everyone in the team is up to speed with what's going on across the project
* Do a release, possibly
* Evaluate the success of the sprint that just ended
    * e.g. looking at burndown chart, seeing how many user stories were completed etc...
* Organise the next sprint
    * Re-estimate tasks that took longer than expected, and possibly roll them over into the new sprint
    * Determine new tasks/stories to be tackled in next sprint
    * Allocate tasks to people

## Releases

A release is when we merge code to master, and is a (at leasts partially) working product.
The goal is to do the first release very early and then iterate.

We'll have several releases throughout the lifetime of the project; something along the lines of:

* Prototypes, starting as early as possible
    * Minimal/incomplete features
    * Testing integration of features
* MVP, 1-2 sprints before the final project is due
    * Basic minimal requirements met
* Final product
    * Thoroughly tested and polished

## TODO

In our project plan, we should build in extra time to accommodate for tasks going over time etc...
